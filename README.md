[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/justcompile/bifrost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/justcompile/bifrost)

Bifrost is a command line tool to aid with the deployment of code to AWS instances using the [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) library. Currently in beta.

## Installation
`sudo pip install git+http://github.com/justcompile/bifrost`

## Usage
From the top level of your project repository, you can run the following
### Commands

`init`

will generate a configuration file which bifrost will use when communicating with the servers. It will prompt the user for a number of questions to help build the file such as AWS EC2 tags, deployment directory etc.

#### args

* `name`: the name of the configuration file to generate *[defaults: bifrost.cfg]*.

---

`deploy`

will initiate the deployment for the given project. By default it will deploy to all roles by calling the `deploy` task.

#### args
* `-n/--name` : specifies the name of configuration to use *[defaults: bifrost.cfg]*.
* `-t/--task` : prints out a list of available tasks in the case where custom ones have been added
* `task1 task2 ...`: If you wish to manually override the task(s) to execute.

### Examples

To generate the default configuration file:

```#!bash
# To generate the default configuration file
bifrost init

# To specify the name of the configuration file
bifrost init -n bifrost-staging.cfg

# To deploy to all roles from the `default` branch
bifrost deploy

# To deploy to all roles from a different branch:
bifrost deploy deploy:branch=feature/PROD_1234

# To deploy to a specific role from a different branch:
bifrost deploy deploy_web:branch=feature/PROD_1234

# To run a particular task:
bifrost deploy my_task:param1=1234

# To deploy to all roles and run a task:
bifrost deploy deploy:branch=feature/PROD_1234 my_other_task
